Code Overview
-------------

### App.js

This is the main component of the application. It manages the state and handles the CRUD operations for the tasks.

### State

*   `viewCompleted`: Boolean to toggle between viewing completed and incomplete tasks.
*   `todoList`: Array of tasks.
*   `modal`: Boolean to toggle the visibility of the modal.
*   `activeItem`: Object representing the current task being added or edited.

### Methods

*   `componentDidMount()`: Fetches the list of tasks when the component mounts.
*   `refreshList()`: Fetches the list of tasks from the API and updates the state.
*   `toggle()`: Toggles the visibility of the modal.
*   `handleSubmit(item)`: Handles the submission of a new or edited task.
*   `handleDelete(item)`: Deletes a task.
*   `createItem()`: Prepares the state for adding a new task.
*   `editItem(item)`: Prepares the state for editing an existing task.
*   `displayCompleted(status)`: Filters the tasks based on their completion status.
*   `renderTabList()`: Renders the tab list for toggling between completed and incomplete tasks.
*   `renderItems()`: Renders the list of tasks.

### Components

`Modal`: A component for displaying a modal to add or edit tasks.

API
---

The application interacts with a backend API to perform CRUD operations on the tasks. The base URL for the API is defined as `API_BASE_URL`.

### Endpoints

*   `GET /api/todos/`: Fetches the list of tasks.
*   `POST /api/todos/`: Creates a new task.
*   `PUT /api/todos/:id/`: Updates an existing task.
*   `DELETE /api/todos/:id/`: Deletes a task.

Deployment
----------

To deploy the application, you can use services like Vercel, Netlify, or any other static site hosting service. Ensure that the API is accessible from the deployed application.
